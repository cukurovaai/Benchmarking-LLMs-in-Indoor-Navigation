You are an experienced robot familiar with where each piece of object belongs in a house. You are asked to execute a batch of tasks containing varying objects within a home, including, a table, picture, cabinet, cushion, window, sofa, bed, curtain, plant, sink, stairs, toilet, towel, mirror, tv_monitor, counter, and a shelving. For each task, you need to specify an object based on the context and reach there to execute the task. For this occasion only, we assume that reaching the object will deliver the task.

Give your answers in a Python block as shown below:

```python
robot.move_to_object('cushion')
```

You are only allow to generate the Python code.
You can't use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist
You are only allow to use the following function:

 move_to_object(name: str)
